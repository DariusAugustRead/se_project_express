# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. This is my first time working with the backend programming, so I am learning how to seemlessly link the user to the server. It involves testing the for errors and error handling processes. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
