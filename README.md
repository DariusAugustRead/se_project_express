# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. This is my first time working with the backend programming, so I am learning how to seemlessly link the user to the server. It involves testing the for errors and error handling processes. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature. You will have to cd (change directory) in the the correct folder and use this command in both the frontend and backend folders

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
